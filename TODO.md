## Admin
- Make breadcrumb block work/do something
- Make options block do something (Filter/New buttons)
- Implement search (probably easy with panels)
- Split notifications/user dropdown from main layout
- Look into Javascript implementation
- Figure out a more elegant 404 solution

## General
- Flesh out auth/user API
- Add roles/permissions
